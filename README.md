Hello user! I am conducting a case study on NFL Runningback players. They are known the be the most injury prone players in the sport. 
I want to find what factors contribute to the player's injuries such as usage, age, experience in the league, etc.
I want to ultimately be able to create an ML model to predict possible injuries from the upcoming players in the 2025 NFL season!

# How I am making this project
I am currently developing this under jupyter notebook. I am currently planning to use only Python and python packages like pandas.
I am going to stick with saving the tables as csv files to allow easier reproducibility. I am using duckdb python package to implement SQL!
I am using github for version controlling and my linkedin to communicate significant updates!
